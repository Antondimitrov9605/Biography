### &#x20;Autobiography of Anton Zdravkov Dimitrov

My journey in science began during my undergraduate studies (2016–2020) in Maritime Navigation at Nikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy in Varna, Bulgaria. There, I developed a profound interest in astronomy, navigation, and the practical application of scientific knowledge beyond the maritime domain.

Between **2017 and 2018**, I actively participated in the **International Astronomical Search Collaboration (IASC)** program. During four observation campaigns:

- May 19 – June 17, 2017
- June 17 – July 15, 2017
- July 16 – August 15, 2017
- January 8 – February 7, 2018\
  I conducted astronomical observations and data analysis leading to the discovery of numerous asteroids, several of which were officially designated with my initials – **AZD**. This experience built the foundation of my scientific methodology and practical research approach.

In 2017, I presented a research paper titled:
**“Integration of Astronavigation Knowledge in the Study of the Main Asteroid Belt in the Solar System”** at the **International Scientific Session** at the Naval Academy.

Later that year, I co-authored and presented a paper at the **18th Annual General Assembly of the International Association of Maritime Universities (IAMU AGA 18)**, titled:
**"Practical Application of Knowledge by Astronavigation for the Discovery of New Asteroids in the Solar System."** The publication was included in **Volume III** of the official proceedings (pages 178–183).

In 2017, I also completed an IMO-certified course:\
**"Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation (OPRC) Level 1 – First Responder"**, enhancing my competence in environmental security within maritime transport. During the same year, I undertook additional trainings in:

- **Total Crisis Management and Crisis Communication**
- **Total International Management and International Communication**\
  These programs deepened my understanding of global communication strategies and crisis response in international maritime and organizational contexts.

While working full-time at the port as a **foreman** in **port operations** and **operational logistics**, I began expanding my competencies in the field of economics and leadership. I completed specialized training programs at **Bulgarian Educational Cybernetics**, covering:

- **Finance**
- **Trade and Commerce**
- **Business Planning**
- **Strategic Management and Development**

These courses helped me build a strong foundation in entrepreneurship, market dynamics, and strategic operations.

During this period, I also enrolled in a master's degree in **Cybersecurity (2023–2025)**, balancing full-time responsibilities with academic advancement. In parallel with my cybersecurity studies, I pursued certifications in blockchain technologies through Udemy, deepening my knowledge in decentralized systems and smart contract development.

In March 2025, I received recognition as a **Certified Solana Builder**, issued jointly by HackQuest and the **Solana Foundation**.

During this time, I also began conducting research in the field of artificial intelligence. I explored various machine learning and large language models, including OpenAI's GPT series, Meta's LLaMA, Google’s BERT, and open-source models like Mistral and DeepSeek. These studies allowed me to experiment with model fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and integration with smart contract environments.

Currently pursuing advanced AI coursework through HarvardX:
CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python
Machine Learning and AI with Python (CS109x)
Focus areas: search algorithms, neural networks, ML pipelines, and Python-based data processing.
This diversified academic and practical background laid the foundation for my transition into cybersecurity, where I now explore the intersection of science, finance, blockchain, and digital security.
My passion for innovation and scientific exploration remains central to my identity - combining astronomy, navigation, economics, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity to contribute to a sustainable and secure future.

Alongside my full-time work at the port, I am also developing several side projects that integrate blockchain and AI technologies:

1. AI off-chain smart contract threat detection management system -
Machine Learning-Based Vulnerability Classification Smart Contracts Using BERT Embeddings
Rust - Solana-

A Rust based off-chain AI vulnerability detection system for smart contracts on Solana .
Uses BERT embeddings and ML classification for real-time threat analysis. Aims to improve DeFi security via scalable, decentralized auditing tools.

2. AI-driven application for asteroid discovery-
   A machine learning-based platform for automatic asteroid detection using NASA/Pan-STARRS datasets.
   Integrates with Solana to register discoveries as NFTs and timestamped claims,
    enabling new scientific provenance and citizen science incentive mechanisms.

3. Integration of blockchain and AI for port logistics and operational efficiency-
   A Solana-powered supply chain optimization system for ports, combining AI route prediction with tokenized logistics assets.
   Designed to boost operational efficiency and transparency in maritime and port operations.

4. Decentralized investment crypto fund-
   A decentralized crypto investment fund with AI strategy ranking and governance mechanisms,
   built on Solana using SPL tokens, smart contract voting and investor dashboards.
   Focus on transparency, community engagement, and performance analytics.

5. Quantum Library – a blockchain-integrated scientific publication repository-
    A decentralized repository for scientific research papers, powered by blockchain timestamping,
    quantum-proof storage, and NFT-based peer review tracking. Uses Solana for metadata,
   access rights, and public proof of originality.

6. Space-themed video game with AI-based crypto-economy-
    A play-to-earn strategy game using Solana for in-game assets and AI to balance the in-game economy.
   Players explore space, trade, and conquer, while assets are represented by compressed NFTs and staking mechanics.

7. A Private Tech/AI School for Students (Primary/Secondary)-
 An educational platform and token-gated AI academy for children (ages 10–18) with Solana-based identity,
 achievements, and rewards system. Uses AI tutors, interactive dashboards and gamification to engage young learners in blockchain and AI.
