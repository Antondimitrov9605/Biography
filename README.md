### &#x20;Autobiography of Anton Zdravkov Dimitrov

My journey in science began during my undergraduate studies (2016–2020) in Maritime Navigation at Nikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy in Varna, Bulgaria. There, I developed a profound interest in astronomy, navigation, and the practical application of scientific knowledge beyond the maritime domain.

Between **2017 and 2018**, I actively participated in the **International Astronomical Search Collaboration (IASC)** program. During four observation campaigns:

- May 19 – June 17, 2017
- June 17 – July 15, 2017
- July 16 – August 15, 2017
- January 8 – February 7, 2018\
  I conducted astronomical observations and data analysis leading to the discovery of numerous asteroids, several of which were officially designated with my initials – **AZD**. This experience built the foundation of my scientific methodology and practical research approach.

In 2017, I presented a research paper titled:
**“Integration of Astronavigation Knowledge in the Study of the Main Asteroid Belt in the Solar System”** at the **International Scientific Session** at the Naval Academy.

Later that year, I co-authored and presented a paper at the **18th Annual General Assembly of the International Association of Maritime Universities (IAMU AGA 18)**, titled:
**"Practical Application of Knowledge by Astronavigation for the Discovery of New Asteroids in the Solar System."** The publication was included in **Volume III** of the official proceedings (pages 178–183).

In 2017, I also completed an IMO-certified course:\
**"Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation (OPRC) Level 1 – First Responder"**, enhancing my competence in environmental security within maritime transport. During the same year, I undertook additional trainings in:

- **Total Crisis Management and Crisis Communication**
- **Total International Management and International Communication**\
  These programs deepened my understanding of global communication strategies and crisis response in international maritime and organizational contexts.

While working full-time at the port as a **foreman** in **port operations** and **operational logistics**, I began expanding my competencies in the field of economics and leadership. I completed specialized training programs at **Bulgarian Educational Cybernetics**, covering:

- **Finance**
- **Trade and Commerce**
- **Business Planning**
- **Strategic Management and Development**

These courses helped me build a strong foundation in entrepreneurship, market dynamics, and strategic operations.

During this period, I also enrolled in a master's degree in **Cybersecurity (2023–2025)**, balancing full-time responsibilities with academic advancement. In parallel with my cybersecurity studies, I pursued certifications in blockchain technologies through Udemy, deepening my knowledge in decentralized systems and smart contract development.

In March 2025, I received recognition as a **Certified Solana Builder**, issued jointly by HackQuest and the **Solana Foundation**.

During this time, I also began conducting research in the field of artificial intelligence. I explored various machine learning and large language models, including OpenAI's GPT series, Meta's LLaMA, Google’s BERT, and open-source models like Mistral and DeepSeek. These studies allowed me to experiment with model fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and integration with smart contract environments.



This diversified academic and practical background laid the foundation for my transition into cybersecurity, where I now explore the intersection of science, finance, blockchain, and digital security.

My passion for innovation and scientific exploration remains central to my identity - combining astronomy, navigation, economics, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity to contribute to a sustainable and secure future.

Alongside my full-time work at the port, I am also developing several side projects that integrate blockchain and AI technologies:

1. AI off-chain smart contract threat detection management system -
Machine Learning-Based Vulnerability Classification Smart Contracts Using BERT Embeddings
Solididy- Ethereum
Rust - Solana

3. AI-driven application for asteroid discovery

4. Integration of blockchain and AI for port logistics and operational efficiency

5. Decentralized investment crypto fund

6. Quantum Library – a blockchain-integrated scientific publication repository

7. Space-themed video game with AI-based crypto-economy

8. A Private Tech/AI School for Students (Primary/Secondary)
